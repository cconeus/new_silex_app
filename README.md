# _Silex Shell Launcher_

##### _A small application to create the basic files needed in a Silex application, 9/12/2015 version 1.1 (alpha)_

#### By _**Dana Sharman**_

## Description

_This app adds the web/src/tests/app/views files to a new project folder on the users desktop. It also creats a .gitignore file, a composer.json file containing the routes for Twig, Silex and PHPUnit. Simple to setup, just open the app and the new project folder will be created on your desktop!_

## Setup

* _Clone repository from github_
* _Double click the application to create the shell_
* _Change the name of your project folder to your current project_
* _Open terminal, run composer install to install the proper dependencies for the project_
* _Enjoy!_


_This application does have a few things slotted for improvement. For future releases, I intend to add a shell index.html page to the views file, a basic app.php file which will include the routes to the index.html file and an index.php file for the web folder. This will allow the creation of a fully functional, 1 page website using this framework, and allow new users to visually identify and deduce how the structure works._

## Technologies Used

_PHP, Silex, Twig, Automator(Mac)_
